# Bundled Icons Directory
#
# Location: scripts/build/assets/bundled-icons/
#
# Place .icns files here to bundle them with AppleBlox.
#
# During the build process:
# 1. All .icns files in this directory will be gzipped
# 2. The gzipped icons (.icns.gz) will be copied to the app bundle's Resources/bundled-icons directory
#
# On app launch:
# 1. AppleBlox checks if the bundled icons have been extracted to ~/Library/Application Support/AppleBlox/icons
# 2. If not, it extracts them automatically (gunzip)
# 3. Users can then select these icons from the Icon Manager in the Appearance settings
#
# This ensures bundled icons are only extracted once and don't require app restarts.
