# Neutralino + Svelte

This is a starter template for neutralino that uses **Vite** and **Svelte**. You can directly write your app using svelte!

## Using the template
Simply use the command `neu create app_name --template OrigamingWasTaken/neutralino-svelte`

Then `cd` into your project and do `npm install`

## Running your app

To run your app, use the command `npm run dev`

## Building your app

Fill the `build.config.ts` file in the root of the project and run the `npm run build` command.

> This will package your app for Linux, MacOS, and Windows

## Replacing Svelte

This template can also support Vue, React, etc... as it uses Vite. You can easily swap the frontend.
> Q: Why would I do this instead of using another template?
> A: Well you see, the good thing about this template is that it includes crossplatform build and package scripts. So no need to make your own.
